![](https://geografif.github.io/images/profile.png){: .align-left} Hi, *Hai, Hallo, Hej, Hoi, Hola*!
<p><p>
I am Afif, a student of geo-information science and earth observation under the Erasmus Mundus GEM joint master program with a focus on ecosystems and natural resources. My interests include applying geospatial technology for environmental monitoring and aiding public policy, as well as knowledge sharing. Currently, I am looking for an opportunity to expand my knowledge in the domain of natural resource management, supply chain sustainability assessment, and carbon accounting.

My previous experience before graduate school is summarized <a href="https://geografif.github.io/cv/">here</a>.
