![](https://geografif.github.io/images/profile.png){: .align-left} Hi, *Hai, Hallo, Hej, Hoi, Ahoj, Hola*!
<p><p>
I am Afif, a student pursuing a Master's degree in Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation through the Erasmus Mundus GEM joint master program, with a focus on Ecosystems and Natural Resources. My ongoing studies aim to deepen my understanding of how to extract meaningful information from satellite images for environmental monitoring and support for natural resource management.

<p><p>
My current MSc thesis focuses on deep learning-based fusion of optical and SAR remote sensing images for mapping oil palms in the riparian zone. While I am deeply interested in learning the state-of-the-art geospatial techniques, I am keen to broaden my domain knowledge thus I am seeking opportunities to gain hands-on experience in ecosystem valuation, supply chain sustainability assessment, and carbon accounting.

<p><p>
In my leisure time, I enjoy watching movies, reading, learning new languages, and taking walks in the sunshine to soak up some vitamin D.

<p><p>
Cheers!
