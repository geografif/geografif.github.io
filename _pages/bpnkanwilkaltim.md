### GIS Consultant

Working as a GIS consultant for the Land Administration Regional Office in East Kalimantan was my first job after graduating as a bachelorâ€™s with a geospatial degree. My role was to compile agrarian reform objects with the following criteria:
- State forest area release
- 20% land allocation of corporate plantation concession holder
- Abandoned concession land
- Uncertified transmigration settlement
