**GIS Consultant**
<br>
*Ministry of Agrarian and Spatial Planning of Republic Indonesia - East Kalimantan Regional Office*
<hr/>

Working as a GIS consultant for the Land Administration Regional Office in East Kalimantan was my first job after graduating from college. My role was to compile and manage datasets for agrarian reform objects within the following criteria:
- State forest release areas
- 20% land allocation from corporate plantation's concessions
- Abandoned concession lands
- Uncertified transmigration settlements

Among the criteria, abandoned concession lands are the only criteria that could be directly observed from remotely sensed images if the concession boundaries are known. My article on detecting abandoned land in oil palm concession from remote sensing can be access below
