I was in the art club and student publication body, but my time assisting research was what I enjoyed the most.

I teach undergraduate student. The feedbacks were surprisingly good.

The fun parts were probably the field trip work. There was a time when we went to Karimunjawa Island, and Bali to collect field data. For field data collection of my thesis, we went to Derawan Island, which is habitat to green sea turtles where overpopulation threatened the seagrass ecosystem in the region.

By contributing to data collection, analysis, and report writing, I am co-authoring several research articles. I also had an opportunity to present one of the student-led research in The International Conference on Science and Technology UGM. The publication can be seen in the publication page.

Recently, this research group initiated nationwide seagrass mapping where academia, researcher, practitioner was involved. Several past publication can be found in the group chairâ€™s personal website, the Southeast Asia Seagrass Network, and they are most active in instagram account.

Below are some stuffs that are related to this work are:
