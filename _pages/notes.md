**GIS Officer**

*East Kalimantan Province Government's Department of Spatial Planning*
<hr/>

I joined the Land Control Unit in East Kalimantan Province Governmentâ€™s Department of Spatial Planning in early 2019. My role was to support the geospatial aspect of policy implementation regarding spatial planning and land use permit. In short, my routine was to provide a suitability assessment between the proposed land use activity and the spatial plan prior to the permit issuance by the government.

One of the challenges of working for a local government office was a shortage of staff with geospatial backgrounds in the midst of growing requests for spatial plan suitability analysis documents. This problem was partially solved by allocating in-house training sessions where I shared a bit of geospatial knowledge with the staff while also promoting the use of open-source alternatives for desktop GIS software. A remaining problem that I wished to solve was the provision of a *working* spatial database, which would undoubtedly improve data management and collaborative intra-unit work in the department.

Besides having an opportunity to dive deep into governance and policy stuff, I occasionally piloted unmanned aerial vehicles for collecting additional information of the field condition to complement spatial plan where a land use activity is proposed. I was also involved in several projects. some of them are listed below.
