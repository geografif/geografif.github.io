### Detecting Period of Oil-Palm Driven Deforestation with SITS
<br>
![](/images/posts/thumbnail/timeseries.png){: .align-left} While mapping can answer "where" a phenomenon is, sometimes it is also important to know "when" it happened. Here, two popular satellite image time series analyses were used to detect and map the timing of oil-palm-driven deforestation.

### Polarimetric SAR Features Could Improve Oil Palm Mapping Accuracy
<br>
![](/images/posts/thumbnail/polsar.png){: .align-left} Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) refers to a technique that characterizes the scattering behavior of different objects rather than using brightness alone. How could it improve the mapping accuracy in the oil palm domain?

### Lunds Kommun Land Cover Mapping
<br>
![](/images/posts/thumbnail/lundskommun.png){: .align-left} Mapping land cover from satellite image pixel-based classification approach. What class of land cover should be mapped? Which method should be considered? Are the variables equally important? Let's find out.

### Web-mapping of Bike Pump Facilities in Lund
<br>
![](/images/posts/thumbnail/bike.png){: .align-left} When it comes to cycling infrastructures, designated bike lanes are not the only important thing. The availability of facilities such as air pumps would ease and encourage people to use bikes. In the small student town of Lund, Sweden, here is the distribution.

### Carbon Ecosystem Exchange: An Introduction
<br>
![](/images/posts/thumbnail/carbon.PNG){: .align-left} By consuming light, plants absorb carbon dioxide from the air and transform it into biomass. When died, it emits methane as it rots. Here is a note on the carbon ecosystem exchange concept and related open data that could be used for mapping, monitoring, and spatially modelling carbon in the ecosystem.

### Characterizing Seagrass Dynamics off Derawan Island
<br>
![](/images/posts/thumbnail/derawan.gif){: .align-left} You may have often heard about how forest ecosystems play an important role in maintaining biodiversity and carbon ecosystems. But, have you ever thought that there are other ecosystems that also have a similar role? Here, multi-temporal satellite images were used to characterize change & dynamics in this precious blue carbon ecosystem of seagrasses.

### A simple sunglint correction (deglint) for coastal remote sensing applications
<br>
![](/images/posts/thumbnail/glint.gif){: .align-left} Clouds, cloud shadows, and hazes are among the challenges when working with optical remote sensing images. When the object of interest is located underwater (e.g. seagrasses, coral reefs), a new challenge arises: sunglint. How to deal with it?
