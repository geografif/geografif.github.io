### Detecting Period of Oil-Palm Driven Deforestation with SITS
<br>
![](/images/posts/thumbnail/timeseries.png){: .align-left} Having a dense satellite image time series could be useful for assessing pixel-wise change of land cover, which could be indicated by a significant change in its signal. Here, two popular time-series analysis methods were used to detect deforestation caused by oil palm plantation in Papua, where nation's current largest reserve of rainforests exist and threatened by such deforestation cause.

### Web-mapping of Bike Pump Facilities in Lund
<br>
![](/images/posts/thumbnail/bike.png){: .align-left} Cycling infrastructure is not limited to the designated bikeways (e.g. bike paths, bike lanes, cycle tracks) but also public facilities for pumping air to bike tires. In Lund Municipality, these public pumps are distributed well. Here, a location data was compiled to create web maps of bike pump facility distribution around Lund Municipality.

### Carbon Ecosystem Exchange: An Introduction
<br>
![](/images/posts/thumbnail/carbon.PNG){: .align-left} As plants consume sunlight and carbon dioxide from air, the carbon stored in plants biomass. As it rots, it releases methane where carbon returns to the atmosphere. Here are some some notes on carbon ecosystem exchange concept and related open data that could be used for mapping, monitoring, and spatially modelling carbon in the ecosystem.

### Characterizing Seagrass Dynamics off Derawan Island
<br>
![](/images/posts/thumbnail/derawan.png){: .align-left} You may have often heard about how forest ecosystems play an important role in maintaining biodiversity and carbon ecosystems. But, have you ever thought that there are other ecosystems that also have a similar role? Here, Sentinel-2 time-series images were used to monitoring change in this precious blue carbon seagrass ecosystem.

### A simple sunglint correction (deglint) for coastal remote sensing applications
<br>
![](/images/posts/thumbnail/glint.gif){: .align-left} One of the challenges of working with optical remotely sensed satellite images for underwater objects (e.g. benthic habitats such as seagrasses, coral reefs, etc.) is sunglint.
