> `Paper` [Characterizing Derawan seagrass cover change with time-series Sentinel-2 images](/publication/2021-derawan-seagrass)

You may have often heard about how forest ecosystems play an important role in maintaining biodiversity and carbon ecosystems. But, have you ever thought that there are other ecosystems that also have a similar role?

The ecosystem is called seagrass meadows. Located in coastal marine waters, seagrasses offer a variety of ecosystem services as a habitat for sea creatures to forage and grow, which indirectly contributes to the fisheries sector. Its presence is also able to overcome sediment and maintain water clarity. In addition, seagrasses are also blue carbon ecosystem, which refers to the ability of non-terrestrial ecosystems to absorb carbon and reduce the impact of climate change.

Despite the benefits, seagrass ecosystems are declining worldwide. While it is mainly caused by human activities such as coastal development and sedimentation, a study by <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2013.2890">Marjolijn</a> (whom I luckily encountered and had discussion with during my fieldwork) showed that overgrazing by seagrass-consuming herbivores may also threaten the sustainability of seagrass ecosystems. In the coastal water of Derawan Island, Berau, Indonesia, for example, apart from being reported to have the highest population density of green turtles in the world which triggers overgrazing, the rampant development of inns on the coast to support tourism has also contributed in putting pressure to seagrass ecosystem in this region.

The first step in managing seagrass ecosystems is by knowing where they are distributed. To date, there have been some initiatives to provide information on seagrass distribution such as:
* [SeagrassSpotter](https://seagrassspotter.org/), a citizen science tool to locate seagrass from an observation point through smartphones
* [UNEP WCMC](https://data.unep-wcmc.org/datasets/7), which provides global seagrass distribution map, despite [incosistency and accuracy issues](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab7d06)
* [Allen Coral Atlas](https://allencoralatlas.org/), which despite its focus on mapping global coral reefs, also provides benthic habitat maps where seagrass is included in the classification scheme. I noticed that Derawan seagrass is [massively underestimated](#Update)

The Oceanographic Research Center of the Indonesian Institute of Sciences and Sciences (now BRIN) is supposed to provide official seagrass map. While it has been appointed as the national data parent of seagrass map for years through the so-called One Map Policy, the result of their work is yet to be seen. With uncertainties introduced by global initiatives, developing a local method would be preferable. Here, publicly available remote sensing data that captures the area on repeat, such as Sentinel-2, can be used to map the extent, the abundance, and assess the changes that are occurring to contribute to the information on seagrass ecosystems in the tropical Indo-Pacific region that currently is still limited.

Using data collected from photo-transect fieldwork, Sentinel-2 images taken within the same month are classified using two different method, which are maximum likelihood and random forest. Through validation using independent field data sets, random forest was found to provide map with better accuracy, therefore was used as the basis for estimating seagrass abundance quantitatively.

The abundance, which is represented by percentage cover, was empirically modeled based on the statistical relationship between field measurement and reflectance values of the corresponding pixels of the image taken within the same month. The established equation was applied to time-series images, producing multi-temporal seagrass cover maps. It appears that seagrass abundance tends to be low in the beginning of the year, increase in the middle of the year, and decline by the end of the year. This tropical seagrass seasonal pattern was explained in a [study](https://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/45599/).

There are limitations that have not been addressed in this study. Therefore, future study should consider minimizing the difference in reflectance at different times due to tidal variations, use denser time-series data and longer period, take advantage of the time-series analysis package that has been developed and publicly available, and integrate spatial model to accommodate drivers that may trigger changes in seagrass in the study area.

Update 2022: Allen Coral Atlas
</h2>

Recently, the Allen Coral Atlas was asking for feedback for benthic habitat maps in the Southeast Asia region. Their [benthic habitat map](https://allencoralatlas.org/atlas/#13.99/2.2863/118.2523) underestimates seagrass distribution in the Derawan region. This is expected as the region is dominated by fast-growing species of *Halodule uninervis*, which form patchy rather than continuous seagrass beds. The patchiness would allow more reflectance from the background to be recorded by remote sensor, hence the global method of Allen Coral Atlas would classify those areas as other benthic objects. Therefore, it would be a good opportunity to point out the flaw on their map.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In collaboration with <a href="https://twitter.com/seasktch?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@seasktch</a>, we are seeking feedback on the geomorphic and benthic habitat maps of the Southeast Asian Archipelago to create version 2 maps for the region: <a href="https://t.co/ggm9IrTPoi">https://t.co/ggm9IrTPoi</a> <a href="https://t.co/FuFn3CH5Vx">pic.twitter.com/FuFn3CH5Vx</a></p>&mdash; Allen Coral Atlas, powered by ASU (@AllenCoralAtlas) <a href="https://twitter.com/AllenCoralAtlas/status/1532428591912218624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 2, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

P.S. The dominancy of *Halodule uninervis* is caused by constant disturbance of green sea turtle grazing. Previously, it was reported that other species existed. Wouldn't it be interesting to see spatial assessment of species shifting?
