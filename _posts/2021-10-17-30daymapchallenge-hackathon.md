In welcoming November when the [#30daymapchallenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) would take place, The University of Tartu hosted a hackathon where groups of students prepared maps to participate in this yearâ€™s challenge<!--more-->. The hackathon was opened with plenary talk from Topi Tjukanov as the challenge initiator himself. This event is held for two days, from 15 to 16 October.

Among the participants were students from the GEM and Geoinformatics programmes, with teachers acted as the mentors. While students in Estonia participated the event in-person, GEM students from Lund University joined remotely.

I was grouped with Kate and Chris, both are GEM students in The University of Tartu, and we were assigned topics for day 8 (blue), day 14 (map with a new tool), day 20 (movement), and day 21 (elevation). After brain-stormed about what, where, and how the data were going to be visualized, we splitted the work based on the topic and peer-review each other's outputs. My part was the blue topic, in which I map the distribution of coral reefs in the coral triangle.

Being hesitant to participate at first (because of remote participation, while also working on the final project for my home university course), it turned out to be a fun experience. It was a great chance to know and collaborate with fellow mentees on the other side of the Baltic sea, to receive inputs from mentors, and to improve skills in cartography.

Collection of produced maps by students can be seen on [GEM MSc twitter page](https://twitter.com/GemMsc).
