* Pay application fee before appointment date. Be careful when making a payment from non-Swedish bank account.

One should update the new details to the Tax Agency

  * Muenster Hbf - Enschede (~1h)

The validity period will be used by the Dutch Immigration Office to grant *permit* to stay in the Netherlands for study.
* Check the validity of Swedish residence permit. It might be requried to ask for extension, where issuing a new residence permit card would require submitting new biometrics
* Submitting biometrics in the Schengen area can be done in the embassy of Sweden in the following cities: Berlin, Paris, Madrid, Rome, Athens
* The new card can be send to an embassy overseas or personal address in the Schengen area

### Local transportation in Enschede
* While many countries including Sweden charge commuters with zone-based ticket that is valid for all modes of transportation, transportation system in the Netherlands charges by distance
* While public transportation card is [useful](https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/plan-your-trip/getting-around/public-transport/public-transport-chip-card) for beneficial subscription schemes, ticket can also be purchased through app (e.g. 9292 & Keolis for bus, NS for train)
