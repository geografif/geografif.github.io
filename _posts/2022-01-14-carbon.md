At the end of the course, students are required to do group projects. Project, unlike practical exercise, is where students are given spaces for creativity to choose topic, research questions, objectives, and methods by themselves instead of following given instruction. For GIS Advcance course, there are four project topics available, which are climate classification, carbon balance, accessibility, and hydrological modelling, each supervised by a different teacher.

Being in the Ecosystem and Natural Resources track, I found the carbon balance topic to be interesting. It was challenging, however, as I had no background related to this topic, while the course itself was focused on the GIS side rather than ecosystem processes. All the mathematical equations seemed so intimidating. Nevertheless, it is always good to learn something new, and it might be useful as the introduction to the upcoming courses. Luckily, a lot of studies have been published out there, and here are some stuffs that I have summarized:

## Vegetation as primary producers
In secondary school, we might have learned about how plants can turn carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight, into *food* and oxygen. This *food* produced from the process contains carbon, and the process is called photosynthesis. In the terrestrial ecosystem, forests play important role in absorbing carbon from the atmosphere through this process. For forest trees, the absorbed carbon are stored mostly as woody biomass in trunk and branches. Others go to leaves, roots, and soils. The amount of carbon uptake from photosynthesis is what we call *Gross Primary Productivity* (*GPP*).

As previously mentioned, the production rate of an ecosystem is affected by the amount of carbon dioxide in the air, water availability (associated with precipitation rate), and sun radiation intensity. Another unmentioned important factor is temperature, which is positively correlated with *GPP* until a certain point [1].

Just like humans, plants need to breathe to break down the *food* into energy to maintain their function (like growing, transporting nutrients, and performing photosynthesis). While breathing, plants release carbon dioxide. This is called *autotrophic respiration* (*Ra*) which release carbon back to the atmosphere. The difference between *GPP* and *Ra* is termed *Net Primary Productivity* (*NPP*) and could be estimated using the following equation:

> `NPP = GPP - Ra`

There is also popular asssumption that roughly estimates *NPP* as 50% of *GPP* [1].

## Other respiration
When plants die, their bodies are broken down into simple organic matter by microorganisms and eventually released as gas (mostly carbon dioxide). This process is called *heterotrophic respiration* (*Rh*). Temperature and water availability seem to be dominant factors that affect *Rh* rate [2].

By considering *Rh* component that emits carbon from the ecosystem back to the atmosphere, one could estimate *Net Ecosystem Production* (*NEP*), which is the difference between *NPP* and *Rh*, formulated as below:

> `NEP = NPP - Rh` or `NEE = Rh - NPP`

In case *NPP* is higher than *Rh*, the ecosystem would be a net sink, which means it stores carbon. It is not impossible for *NPP* to be lower than *Rh*, implying the ecosystem would be a net source that releases carbon to the atmosphere.

> Ecosystem production is often expressed in unit of mass per unit area per unit time, for example, mass of carbon per meter square per year (gCm-2y-1). Occasionally, carbon also expressed in molC. To convert unit mol to gram, multiply the value with the carbon molar mass, which is 12. Therefore, 1 molCm-2y-1 is equivalent to 12 gCm-2y-1.

## How are these measured?
On a local scale, eddy-covariance flux towers are used to measure carbon exchange between atmosphere and ecosystem. However, spatially explicit estimates are more favorable and this is where GIS would be useful. Many have linked field inventories of tree measurements to vegetation classes interpreted from remotely sensed data to estimate vegetation structure such as aboveground biomass and carbon stocks. This method often involves allometric equations and has been widely adopted in environmental assessment such as [High Carbon Stock](https://highcarbonstock.org/the-hcs-approach-toolkit/) Another common way to estimate vegetation structures is by building statistical relationship between measurerement of vegetation structure variable with reflectance value of the corresponding pixel of remote sensing data. [Lidar](https://twitter.com/m_mokros/status/1433088795352645635) sensors offer different approach by providing point clouds that enable direct volume estimation of vegetation structure. Another approach is to model vegetation processes such as productivity rate based on light use efficiency model involving *Photosynthetically Active Radiation* (APAR) and how much area to perform photosynthesis, represented by [*Leaf Area Index*](https://twitter.com/BzGEO/status/1391830675070795781) (*LAI*) [3]. Process-based ecosystem model, on the other hand, could describe the mechanistic or cause and effect in ecosystem dynamics and predicting response to changing input environmental variables, althought it is often not necessarily a spatially explicit model.

As this project is part of GIS Advance course, selection of method would be dictated by the availability of spatial data.

## Data
Listed below are open access data that could be useful in this project topic.

One should consult MODIS [user's guide](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/495/MOD17_User_Guide_V6.pdf) document to see the scale factor of the datasets, as well as other properties. Other meteorological data such as temperature and precipitation data are often available from meteorological stations, in which one needs to interpolate the point data into a continuous surface first. In Sweden, this data is provided by [SMHI](https://www.smhi.se/). Data on (surface) temperature could also be obtained from MODIS product. Other production and respiration datasets are also published by [Hashimoto](http://cse.ffpri.affrc.go.jp/shojih/data/index.html), although the resolution might be very coarse.

## Methods
Researchers usually have resources (sites or tools) to obtain data to develop or run their conceptual model. This model, which is also known as process-based model, requires variables in which the data are not easily obtainable for general use. Hence, practitioners often depend on what is already out there, whether it’s data or method, with the latter being a simple model that requires less variables [4].

MODIS *NPP* data is available on an annual basis. It is created based on *GPP* data which are available every eight days. Unless the aim is to capture phenology and seasonality, analysis could be done on annual timestep. Since the *NPP* is already provided, the next thing to do is to estimate *Rh*. One could opt to apply what is already out there, or create their own model from the available data.

Things to consider when estimating respiration are the base respiration rate, which is the rate at 0 degree celcius temperature, and the *Q10*, which is the constant defining change in respiration rate for 10 degree celcius temperature change.

## How is it validated?
Assuming MODIS NPP is a scientifically trusted product, the comparison could be made for other estimated outputs with available measurement data from flux towers, if possible. Another way is to made comparison to previous studies representing similar sites, ecosystem, or biome as the benchmark. Difference of estimates is expected due to different approach used, but any estimation closer to the benchmark would be great. One could also compare the ecosystem exchange to [GFW interactive map](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/map/?map=eyJjZW50ZXIiOnsibGF0Ijo1NS43OTYyODI2MzIyMTQ4MjYsImxuZyI6MTMuMzM3NTg1NDQ5MjE3NTUxfSwiem9vbSI6Ny45OTk5OTk5OTk5OTk5OTksImRhdGFzZXRzIjpbeyJkYXRhc2V0IjoibmV0LWNhcmJvbi1mbHV4LXRlc3QiLCJvcGFjaXR5IjoxLCJ2aXNpYmlsaXR5Ijp0cnVlLCJsYXllcnMiOlsibmV0LWNhcmJvbi1mbHV4LTIwMDEtMjAyMCB0ZXN0Il19LHsiZGF0YXNldCI6InBvbGl0aWNhbC1ib3VuZGFyaWVzIiwibGF5ZXJzIjpbImRpc3B1dGVkLXBvbGl0aWNhbC1ib3VuZGFyaWVzIiwicG9saXRpY2FsLWJvdW5kYXJpZXMiXSwib3BhY2l0eSI6MSwidmlzaWJpbGl0eSI6dHJ1ZX1dfQ%3D%3D&mapMenu=eyJkYXRhc2V0Q2F0ZWdvcnkiOiJjbGltYXRlIn0%3D&mapPrompts=eyJvcGVuIjp0cnVlLCJzdGVwc0tleSI6InN1YnNjcmliZVRvQXJlYSJ9).

## Result
Coming soon.

## Future works
Keep in mind that this project is part of GIS Advance course, therefore emphasize more on data harmonization (normalization of units, spatial reference, storage), quality, geoprocessing methods (mathematical operations, overlay, interpolation, geostatistics), and cartographic visualization. Some aspects that could be add for improvement related to the topic are:
* Include more variables
* Apply more sophisticated model
* Aim for seasonality or multi-years assessment
* Account for land cover change
* Assess the variation in different forest types
