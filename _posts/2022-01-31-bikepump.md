Lund is a student town. Its size is quite small that every corner is <!--more-->reachable within ~15 minutes. Well, that actually depends on which mode of transportation you use. Most people use bikes to mobilize because the infrastructure (e.g. bike lanes) is quite good here (that’s a well-spent tax money!). Students also can save up money worth two grocery shopping times when they are not subscribing to a monthly bus ticket. Therefore, biking is undoubtedly one of the important parts of student life in Lund.

While relying on a bike to get around the town, it is important to conduct routine maintenance. Chain might get rusty, lamp might run out of battery, and tire's air pressure might deplete. In the latter case, there are pump facilities distributed across the town that can be used to inflate bike tires. However, not all bike tires are equipped with the same type of valve. Luckily, most of the public pump and store-owned (hose attached on the outside wall of the bike stores) facilities  are provided with at least two different pump head that would fit to different type of valve.

In general, there are three types of valve, which are Dunlop, Presta, and Schrader, each has different capability in maintaining air pressure of the tire. The most common valve type of bike tires in Lund is the Dunlop type. The pump head that works for Dunlop type would also work for Presta type, while Schrader type has its own pump head.

Few weeks ago, I was in a situation where my bike tire needed to be inflated. The closest public pump from my position was in Entrégatan, in which the facility is a machine-like pump that supposed to automatically blow air once connected and pressed to the valve. As I tried to inflate my tire, I could not feel any difference on the tire. That was when I figured out the pump is not working. Eventually, I managed to find another one that worked.

Up until now, there is currently limited information on the condition and description of pump facility, and therefore, I collected them based on initial location of pump facilities from [Pumpacykeln website](https://pumpacykeln.se/stader/lund/lund.html). The data is presented on map below:

In the case the pump head does not fit the valve, the workaround is to have some sort of [valve adapters](https://www.biltema.se/en-se/bike-electrical-bike/bike-accessories/bike-pumps/valve-adapters-4-pcs--2000047952). The price for a [manual pump](https://www.jula.se/catalog/fritid/cykel/bike-accessories-ead4e858/cykelpumpar/cykelpump-004753/) is affordable if someone wants to own one, with the most basic type costing ~60 SEK. Last but not least, try to not be wasteful and ask if someone in the building has one to borrow.

Since the above leaflet map is pretty basic, you can use more useful map below to navigate to the pump on Google Maps
